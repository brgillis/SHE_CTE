Changelog for SHE_CTE Common Testing Environment

Changes in v9.2
===============

API Changes
-----------

Dependency Changes
------------------
- PPT 9.3.1 -> 9.4.1

Deprecated Features
-------------------

Bug Fixes
---------
- Convert 'MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH' version string to 'MAJOR.MINOR' release string for FileNameProvider.get_allowed_filename
- Ensure ShearEstimatesMerge does not fail if there are missing products or measurement FITS files

New Features
------------
- Suppress verbose table format warnings in ShearEstimatesMerge
- ObjectIdSplit now returns a listfile of MER catalog xml products instead of a listfile-of-listfiles
- ObjectIdSplit now writes outputs to workdir and workdir/data instead of subdirectories
- (Sub)ObjectIdSplit can now read in MER products directly - no Listfile required
- New ConvertToHDF5 executable for converting VIS images and reprojected segmentation maps to HDF5
- New executable SHE_CTE_GenerateDetectorListfile that writes a listfile of each NISP or VIS CCDID
- New routines for group identification and batching in SHE_CTE_PipelineUtility.clustering
- ObjectIdSplit now uses the above clustering code

New Config Features
-------------------

Miscellaneous
-------------


Changes in v9.1
===============

Dependency Changes
------------------
- SHE_PPT 9.3.1
- No longer depends on SHE_LensMC or SHE_MomentsML

Deprecated Features
-------------------
- SHE_CTE_EstimateShear

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fix for test_shear_estimate_flags not setting the image header correctly
- Fix bug in ShearEstimatesMerge where methods with no data were given the filename "None"
- Fix bug in (Sub)ObjectIdSplit where filenames were not unique enough, and some name conflicts could arise

New Features
------------
- SHE_CTE_ReconcileShear now fills out the PointingIdList and ObservationIdList attributes of created data products
- Refactored ObjectIdSplit to avoid using the SheFrameStack, and if at all possible to avoid reading the VIS FITS files at all, instead trying to get all its information from the XML products directly.
- Smoketest for SHE_CTE_ShearEstimatesMerge
- SHE_CTE_ShearEstimatesMerge now optionally merges LensMC chains. The original behaviour was that it had to take LensMC chains as an input

Miscellaneous
-------------
- Removed deprecated parameter "allow_pickled" from read/write_xml_product function calls
- Run pytest in a GitLab CI/CD pipeline


Changes in v9.0
=========================

API Changes
-----------

Dependency Changes
------------------
Now depends on DataModel 9.1 indirectly through LensMC 9.0 and MomentsML 9.0

Deprecated Features
-------------------

Bug Fixes
---------

New Features
------------
- Batching is now carried out spatially, and objects within the user-specified grouping radius are grouped together and flagged as such (for LensMC to do joint fitting on these objects)

New Config Features
-------------------
- added the SHE_CTE_ObjectIdSplit_grouping_radius config option to SHE_CTE_ObjectIdSplit. (Default is 1")

Miscellaneous
