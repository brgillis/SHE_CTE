A MultNet is a variant of a Net, with a first hidden layer performing multiplications.
This first layer needs special initialization, and is not optimized at the same pace as the second part.


Things to keep in mind:
 - in case you call Net.setidentity, you WANT to call MultNet.multini again to set the initial params of the first mult layer.
 - you probably don't want to add noise to the mult layer if you're not optimizing it. One way of doing this is to use multwscale=0.0, multbscale=0.0.
